I have made this into a Jekyll Theme.
**Demo:** [http://webjeda.com/online-cv/](http://webjeda.com/online-cv/)

The default theme would look like this

![online cv Jekyll theme](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/raw/master/assets/images/online-cv-jekyll-theme.png)

The theme is responsive

There are 6 color schemes available
