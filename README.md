# Simple online cv

I wanted to know how GitHub Pages works, so I created a simple online CV.

I have used a Jekyll Theme created by webjeda. The default theme would look like here [http://webjeda.com/online-cv/](http://webjeda.com/online-cv/).

Original theme is designed by Xiaoying Riley at 3rd Wave Media (http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/).
