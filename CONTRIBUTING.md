# Contributing to modern-resume-theme
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added/changed anything that relates to the config, please update relevant config files in the `_test` directory.  
    These are used to run tests and build a review app for the PR.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/issues/new?template=bug_report.md); we've even got bug templates to make it easier for you!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
As this is mostly templating we don't have many linting rules, but please

* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep it tidy and easily understandable

## License
