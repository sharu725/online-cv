    summary: |

      I am a compassionate, skilled and dedicated software developer with experience in different
      programming languages and domains. My skill set is broad. I love to squash the difficult bugs,
      wrangle the chaos of technical debt, and coerce slow queries into living life at near
      real-time speed.

      I live to tackle sticky, deeply-rooted problems. I’m experienced as a
      technical team leader and am passionate about relationship-building, helping others, and
      continuing to improve my own skills.
