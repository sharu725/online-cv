    summary: |
      Είμαι λογίστρια και έχω εργαστεί 1 χρόνο σε αυτόν τον τομέα. Έχω ασχοληθεί με την καταχώρηση οικονομικών πράξεων στα λογιστικά βιβλία,την σύνταξη μηνιαίων
      ισοζυγίων των λογαριασμών, την προπαρασκευή,τον υπολογισμό και την αποπληρωμή του ΦΠΑ και πολλά άλλα. Το 2018 εργάστηκα ως πωλήτρια σε μαγαζί με είδη δώρων.
      Συγκεκριμένα ασχολήθηκα με την εξυπηρέτηση πελατών,όπου βοήθησα τους πελάτες να βρουν τι ακριβώς τους ταιριάζει με βάση τη δική τους μοναδική ταυτότητα και την
      διαχείριση αποθήκης καθώς η κριτική σκέψη, η συνέπεια,η υπολογιστική ικανότητα αντίληψης χώρου και η υπευθυνότητα με βοήθησαν να ανταπεξέλθω και σε
      αυτό το πόστο εργασίας.
