career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My passion for science ignited early,
      sparked by childhood curiosity about dinosaurs,
      leading me to explore diverse scientific subjects from biology to physics through books and online research.
      My academic journey reflects this curiosity. 
      Despite a broad interest in science throughout my pre-university education,
      choosing a specific branch proved challenging.
      I embarked on Electrical Engineering at FEUP initially but later transitioned to Biology at FCUP for my bachelor's degree,
      drawn by the allure of life sciences. Then I've pursued a Master's in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at FCUP
      ***the programming bug won I guess*** &#128517;.
# This journey equipped me with expertise in Python (Pyramid framework) for backend development and frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
# Professionally, I've merged my academic prowess with roles spanning biotech, research,
# and software development. My contributions encompass streamlining development environments,
# managing CI/CD pipelines, orchestrating infrastructure using Kubernetes,
# and fortifying systems through secure authentication services.

# Throughout, my focus remains on advancing technology, 
# optimizing workflows, and fostering synergy between scientific exploration and technological innovation.
