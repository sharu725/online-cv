      - role: Head of Data
        time: Oct 2020 - Sep 2022 · 2 yrs
        company: SeedLegals.com
        details: |
          With 35+ thousand companies and over £1 billion in funding raised, SeedLegals is the largest platform
          for startup funding and legals in the UK. As such, they have some of the most interesting and valuable
          data in their industry.

          In my time working with SL, I've hired and led a wonderful and productive data team, de-siloed
          our source data from a half-dozen disparate systems, built our data warehouse and most of its
          infrastructure, and designed our short and long-term data strategy.

      - role: Business Analyst III
        time: Apr 2018 - Apr 2020 · 2 yrs 1 mo
        company: Rover.com
        details: |
          Millions of completed bookings, hundreds of thousands of active service providers, and more data than
          you can shake a stick at.
          
          While working with Rover, I supported all of Rover Operations: Customer Experience, Safety & Enforcement, Booking Assurance, and Workforce Management.
          I participated in hiring, training, and mentoring new data and business analysts.
          
          My fraud research resulted in workflow changes that saved hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
          by reducing the labor needed to recover disintermediation losses, lowering phishing and account
          takeover attempts, and increasing platform safety.
          
          I engineered a disaster-relief pipeline that cut hurricane and earthquake response rates from multiple
          days to a few hours.
          
          I also wrote the data-literacy module of Rover's SQL 101 coursebook, and co-taught the 5-week course.

      - role: Senior Business Intelligence Analyst
        time: Sep 2013 - Oct 2017 (4 years 2 months)
        company: Wizards of the Coast
        details: |
          Wizards of the Coast—makers of Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, and a thousand other
          games—is a long-time titan in the card-game industry with decades of data on player and customer
          behavior across video games, esports, retail business, and events.
          
          As lead analyst for WotC’s Organized Play division, I developed player behavior models to help
          business understand the impact of program changes, resulting in increased utilization of product—
          considerably reducing printing and shipping inefficiencies.
          
          My team built the data warehouse used for Magic: Duels, which was the first time WotC was able to
          analyze big data from this product line, contributing it to be the most successful installment in the series.
          
          As a Tableau expert, I headed the Tableau Server company-wide rollout, bringing near-real-time insights to stakeholders.
          
          I designed and built an esports commentary pipeline—cutting the roughly 3-week manual process to under 72 hours and dramatically improving its scope.
          
          I conducted research and built valuable models for legal, which aided in favorable outcomes for Wizards and Hasbro.

      - role: Data Analyst & Systems Administrator
        time: Aug 2009 - Dec 2010 (1 year 5 months)
        company: Sound Transit
        details: |
          To provide mass transit to the Pacific Northwest, Sound Transit relies on a lot of contractors and, 
          through their commitment to supporting small and disadvantaged businesses, are responsible for many 
          millions of dollars going to female and minority-owned companies.
          
          While working there I developed a system to acquire, track, and analyze business and workforce data 
          associated with gender and race equality from 500+ companies, ensuring compliance with local and 
          federal contracts. This enabled Sound Transit to obtain and release over $500 million in government 
          grants and was instrumental in the department earning the Rosa Parks Award for outstanding 
          commitment to equality in 2011.
