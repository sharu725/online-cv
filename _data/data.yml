career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been developing customized mobile, web and software solutions using bleeding edge technologies for the past 10+ years. I've worked in multiple industries including VoIP, VPN, hosting, ecommerce, marketing, enterprise resource planning, automobile&heavy metallurgy, and more.

      I can adapt to a team or work independently and meet deadlines safely. I know my way around the full PHP or Node stack, also develop mobile apps using Ionic, Angular or React. I can also handle Linux&Windows server administration, virtualization management (aws, digital ocean, etc), DNS management and even know the Adobe apps suite pretty well.
