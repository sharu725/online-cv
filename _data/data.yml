      details: |
        In the water & agri team I create geo-information services to support decisions with the best available data. To accomplish this, I build Python tools, analyse (geo) data and integrate workflows into operational information systems. I am a trustworthy colleague that delivers results. Furthermore, I exchange knowledge and learn on a daily basis. By establishing system architectures, I integrate complex systems. To optimize routine workflows, I build compact products that summarize geo-data and create overview for the user.
