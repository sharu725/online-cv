education:
    - degree: MSc in Human Computer Interaction
      university: University of Patras, Greece
      time: 2019 - now
      details: During the MHCI it is consolidated the creation of a good, sustainable and human-oriented interaction design.
        That is achieved by giving a solid and wide overview of methods and techniques for a well-founded conception, design,
        implementation. The conceived UX is enhanced through cutting edge technologies like AI and VR/AR.         

    - degree: Master in Business Administration
      university: University of Patras, Greece
      time: 2016 - 2018
      details: Appealed with projects related to problem solving, giving specific solutions, espesially for subjects connected to aviation 
        i chose for Master Thesis to be dealed with the Aircraft Landing Problem at an airport, through the development of a Hybrid 
        Differential Evolution Heuristic Algorithm. The benchmarks test problems (OR-Library, J. E. Beasley) that were used found 
        in a valid online database.
        While i was attempting to solve real life transportation scheduling problems i understood and developed new optimization 
        algorithms. Tests and management of strict resources through the powerfool tools of Matlab ended to be a lucrative process 
        for my skills.

      university: Helenic Air Force Academy, Athens, Greece
      time: 2010 - 2014
      details: During my Diplomatic Thesis i dealt with the automatic recognition of audio material through the development of 
        an algorithmic tool in measurements of sounds, coming from the implementation of appropriate recording scenarios, 
        aircrafts-helicopter (targets).
