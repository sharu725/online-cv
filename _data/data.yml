    summary: |
      I make geo-information tools to support decisions with the best available data. To accomplish this, I analyse (geo) data and related information systems. Furthermore, I exchange knowledge and learn on a daily basis. I am a trustworthy colleague. By establishing system architectures, I integrate complex systems. To optimize routine workflows, I build compact products that summarize geo-data and create overview for the user.
