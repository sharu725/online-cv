    - role: Senior Web Developer
      time: October, 2015 - Present day
      company: Cotronic, S.A. (Grupo Cobra), Málaga
      details: |
        During this period, as I became the only member of the software
        development department, besides being responsible for both the
        front-end and back-end, I was also in charge of the functional
        development of the applications, that is, gathering requirements,
        analyzing use cases, and writing unit tests. Starting to use PHP 7
        for the backend of the new applications, making use of JSON format
        for communications, using jQuery for the front-end and HTML5 with
        bootstrap3 for the creation of responsive designs. During this period,
        in addition to maintaining the aforementioned applications,
        applications have been developed for fleet control, invoicing control,
        payments to external suppliers, and time control of contracted personnel.
        For the set of applications it has also been necessary to create batch
        processes, reading and handling of email inboxes, calls to curl_exec
        simulating web browsers for both the collection of information
        and sending forms.

      details: |
        	Acting primarily as the team's back-end developer, I was in charge
          of the design and maintenance of the database, using MySQL Workbench,
          and also of the creation and optimization of MySQL queries. Building
          a solid PHP back-end, exposing the data to the front-end via RESTFul
          API mainly via XML format. On the front-end part, we had javascript
          making use of an open-source library for user interface design and
          using Xajax to make POST calls to the back-end. During these years
          we developed applications for the management of human resources,
          control of the supply of tools and devices, control of warehouses,
          and management of external suppliers. These applications required 
          document management and also the creation and reading of XLS 
          and PDF files.

    - role: Flex-3 Developer
      time: March, 2009 - October, 2009
      company: Accenture S.A.
      client: Applus Services S.A.
      details: |
          o	Working as a programmer with the Flex 3 framework (Adobe) for a project
          for the client Applus+. In this Project, we used Scrum as a development
          methodology. Tasks to be performed could be specified either in a 
          technical document or in a functional one. These tasks came with 
          their estimated development time. Subversion was used for version control.
          As none of the team members knew the environment, we received a training
          that lasted a couple of weeks and we started working with the client.
          Being one of the developers who learned the technology and the framework
          the fastest, I designed, together with my analyst, the templates and classes
          that we ended up using for the project. In addition to carrying out my tasks,
          in the daily scrum I was in charge of helping colleagues who had problems 
          with their developments.
