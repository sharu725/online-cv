              In my roles as a nurse, I was responsible for coordinating all 
              aspects of patients care. I developed my communication and 
              relational skills, as well as leadership and conflict resolution skills. 
              I was assigned the role of nurse in charge, having to lead the ward, 
              staff, and patients, and manage patient care and staffs duties and 
              responsibilities, as well as all practical aspects of running a shift in 
              a very challenging environment. I also had an active role as a part of the 
              Multidisciplinary Team, in planning and delivering care to patients. I was 
              responsible for managing crisis and complex situations, as well as review the 
              performance of subordinate staff, monthly.

          
    
projects:
      title: Projects
      intro: In my work as a nurse, I implemented a “Mindfulness Group” on the ward, where we 
              taught patients and staff different mindfulness skills, with the objective of developing 
              their coping strategies. I also implemented the Safewards Project on the ward, with the 
              purpose of reducing conflict and restraint and lower incidents on the ward.
              I created a welcome booklet with all the ward’s relevant information for patients and staff 
              new to the ward, to reduce anxieties and promote engagement.
              I also implemented a project denominated “Healthy body, healthy mind”, which consisted of 
              different activities and strategies linking physical health with mental health to improve 
              overall patient health.
      

        skills:
      personal skills: Communication and relational skills, leadership skills, conflict 
      resolution and stress management skills, organizational and managerial skills, and 
      time management skills.
      I also had the opportunity to complete relevant training in my practice as a nurse, 
      which includes Therapeutic Boundaries, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/ Dialectical Behavior 
      Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Stress Management and Conflict Resolution training.
      
      

      personal statement: My name is Teresa Lopes and I’m Portuguese. I’ve moved to the UK from sunny Portugal 
      five years ago to pursue a better life. Up until now I was working as a nurse, however I needed a career 
      change, so I decided to take my love for people and caring to the next level, by emerging myself in the 
      world of people’s profession. I love working with people and that’s why I am so excited to start my career 
      in the Human Resources area.
      In my role as a nurse, I developed essential knowledge and skills transferable to my new area of interest, 
      Human Resources, such as communication and relational skills, time management, teamwork, conflict resolution, 
      performance reviews, leadership and even stress management.
      Ive completed a diploma in Leadership & Management, which has provided me with an amazing insight into the 
      relevance of appropriate management and leadership in the workplace. Im currently finishing the CIPD level 5 
      diploma in Human Resources Management, which has equipped me with amazing tools to be able to continue my work 
      caring for people. Im also currently attending the Damia Group Tech Recruitment Academy. 
      Im fluent in English, but also Portuguese and Spanish, and I’m presently working on my French! 
      Im enthusiastic and eager to learn, I’m quick on my feet, organized, resourceful, reliable, creative, a 
      perfectionist (which sounds like a flaw, but it means I’ll always give my absolute best in any task), I’m very 
      sociable and a great communicator… talking to people comes natural to me. I’m also not afraid to be original and 
      unconventional!
      Im currently looking for a job in Tech recruitment!
