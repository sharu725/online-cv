    This is my own company. I give consulting services to different
    companies, including my previous employers (Ateka, CompuService S.R.L.),
    and some other customers.

    The consulting involves linux server administration tasks, occasional
    changes on old software (java, php), network administration/configuration,
    etc. And the development of new applications.

    I've built mobile applications (using java for Android native, and also
    with Cordova framework), and desktop applications using Electron (using
    HTML and JavaScript), for kiosks to show information to the public
    for different products/services.
