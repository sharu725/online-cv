	* titlepage.xsl: Reworked titlepage template processing to support use of more interesting
	predicates.
	
	Note: in previous versions, at most one title, subtitle, or titleabbrev
	element would be processed for each title page. In the new design, if you
	have multiple title, subtitle, or titleabbrev elements inside an info
	wrapper (you shouldn't!), they will all be processed.
