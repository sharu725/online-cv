Installation
------------

Place the files in this distribution somewhere on your machine.  Adjust
your catalog(s) if appropriate (XML tools frequently do not support 
catalogs, so this may be irrelevant for you).

Please use the following formal public identifier to identify this DTD:

"-//Norman Walsh//DTD DocBk XML V3.1.7//EN"

For example, if your document's top-level element is <book>, and
you are using DocBk XML directly, use the FPI in the DOCTYPE
declaration:

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DTD DocBk XML V3.1.7//EN"
          "/system/identifier/on/your/system/db3xml.dtd" [
...
]>

Or, if you have a higher-level driver file that customizes DocBk XML,
use the FPI in the parameter entity declaration:

<!ENTITY % DocBkXML PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DTD DocBk XML V3.1.7//EN"
           "/system/identifier/on/your/system/db3xml.dtd">
%DocBkXML;
