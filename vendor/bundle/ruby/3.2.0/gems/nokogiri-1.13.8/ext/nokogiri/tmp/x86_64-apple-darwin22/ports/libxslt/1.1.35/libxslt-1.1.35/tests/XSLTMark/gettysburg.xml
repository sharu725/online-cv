Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that "all men are created equal"

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
met on a great battle field of that war. We come to dedicate a portion
of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the
nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger
sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not
hallow, this ground -- The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say
here; while it can never forget what they did here.

It is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great
task remaining before us -- that, from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last
full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve these dead
shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth
of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.
