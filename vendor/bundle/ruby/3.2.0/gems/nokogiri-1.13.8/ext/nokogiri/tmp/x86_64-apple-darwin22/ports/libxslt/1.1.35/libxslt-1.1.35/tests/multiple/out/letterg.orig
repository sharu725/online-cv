<h2>GYPSIES</h2>
<p>They endeavour to persuade
the Ignorant, that they derive
their Origin from the <i>Egyptians</i>, a People
heretofore very famous for <i>Astronomy</i>,
<i>Natural Magick</i>, the art of <i>Divination</i>,
&amp;c. and therefore are great Pretenders
to <i>Fortune-telling</i>.  To colour
their Impostures, they artificially discolour
their Faces, and rove up and
down the Country in a Tatterdemalion
Habit, deluding the ignorant Vulgar,
and often stealing from them what is
not too hot for their Fingers, or too
heavy to carry off.</p>
<p>It is the Custom of these Wretches
to swear all that are admitted into their
Fraternity, by a Form and Articles
annexed into it, administred by the Principal
<i>Maunder</i> or <i>Roguish Strowler</i>, and
which they generally observe inviolably.
The Manner of admitting a
new Member, together with the said
Oath and Articles, are as follows.</p>
<p>The Name of the Person is first
demanded, and a Nick-name is then given
him in its stead, by which he is ever
after called, and in Time, his other

Name is quite forgotten.  Then standing
up in the middle of the Fraternity,
and directing his Face to the <i>Dimber-Damber</i>,
or Prince of the Gang, he
swears in this Manner, as is dictated to
him by one of the most experienced,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <i>Crank-Cuffin</i> do swear to be a
<i>True Brother</i>, and will in all Things,
obey the Commands of the great
<i>Tawny Prince</i>, and keep his <i>Councel</i>,
and not divulge the Secrets of my
Brethren.</p>
<p>I will never leave nor forsake this
Company, but observe and keep all
the Times of Appointments, either
by Day or by Night, in any Place
whatsoever.</p>
<p>I will not teach any one to cant;
nor will I disclose ought of our
Mysteries to them, although they
flog me to death.</p>
<p>I will take my Prince's Part against
all that shall oppose him, or any of
us, according to the utmost of my
Ability; nor will I suffer him, or
any belonging to us, to be abused by
any strange, <i>Abrams</i>, <i>Rufflers</i>, <i>Hookers</i>,
<i>Palliards</i>, <i>Swadlers</i>, <i>Irish-Toyls</i>,
<i>Swig-men</i>, <i>Whip-Jacks</i>, <i>Jark-men</i>,
<i>Bawdy-Baskets</i>, <i>Dommerars</i>, <i>Clapperdogeons</i>,
<i>Patricoes</i> <i>or</i> <i>Curtals</i>, but will
defend him or them as much as I can
against all other <i>Outlyers</i> whatever.</p>
<p>I will not conceal ought I win out
of <i>Libkins</i>, or from the <i>Ruffmans</i>; but
will preserve it for the Use of the
Company.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will cleave to my <i>Doxy
Wap</i> stiffly, and will bring her Duds,
Margery, Praters, Goblet, Grunting-cheats,
or Tibs of the Buttery, or
anything else I can come at, as <i>Winnings</i>
for her <i>Wappings</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Canters</i> have, it seems a Tradition,
that from the Three first articles
of this Oath, the first Founders
of a certain boastful, worshipful Fraternity,
who pretend to derive there
Origin from the earliest Times, borrowed
of them, both the Hint and form
of their Establishment.  And that their
pretended Derivation from the first
<i>Adam</i>, is a Forgery, it being only from
the first <i>Adam Tiler</i>. See ADAM TILER.</p>
<p>At the Admission of a new Brother,
a general Stock is raised for <i>Booze</i>, or
Drink, to make themselves merry on
the Occasion.   As for <i>Peckage</i>, or Eatables,
they can procure it without
Money; for while some are sent to
break the <i>Ruffmans</i>, or Woods and
Bushes, for Firing, others are detached

to filch Geese, Chickens, Hens, Ducks
or Mallards, and Pigs.  Their <i>Morts</i>
are their Butchers, who presently make
bloody Work with what living Things
are brought them, and having made
Holes in the Ground, under some remote
Hedge in an obscure Place, they
make a fire, and broil or boil their
Food, and when 'tis enough, fall to
work, Tooth and Nail, and having
eaten more like Beasts than Men, they
drink more like Swine than human
Creatures, entertaining one another
all the Time with Songs in the <i>Canting</i>
Dialect.</p>
<p>As they live, so they lie together promiscuously,
and know not how to claim
a Property either in their Goods or
Children, and this general Interest ties
them more firmly together, than if
all their Rags were twisted into Ropes
to bind them indissolubly from a Separation;
which detestable Union is farther
consolidated by the above Oath.</p>
<p>They strowl up and down all Summertime
in Droves, and dextrously pick
Pockets, while they are telling of Fortunes;
and the Money, Rings, Silver-Thimbles,
&amp;c. which they get, are
instantly conveyed from one Hand, to
another, till the remotest Person of the
Gang, who is not suspected, because
they come not near the Person robbed,
gets Possession of it, so that in the strictest
Search, it is almost impossible to
recover it, while the Wretches with
Imprecations, Oaths and Protestations,
disclaim the Thievery.  That by
which they are said to get the most
Money, is, when young Gentlewomen
of good Families and Reputations have
happenned to be with Child before
Marriage, a round Sum is often bestowed
among the <i>Gypsies</i>, for some one
<i>Mort</i> to take the Child; and as that
is never heard of more by the true
Mother and Family, so the Disgrace
is kept concealed from the World, and
if the Child lives, it never known its
Parents.</p>
