	Added informalfigure to a number of contexts where it was missing
	Changed the format attribute on graphics back into a notation list

	  attribute to 'entry', 'row', and perhaps a few other places where it
	  was missing.
	Added journal, series, set, and manuscript as values for the pubwork
	  attribute on citetitle
	Removed extraneous '?' from the declaration for indexterm. Indexterms
	  are not allowed to be empty!

	* README: Updated manifest

	* VERSION: Version 3.1.1 released
	
	This release introduces several significant changes:
	
	- An XML version of the OASIS Exchange Table Model
	  is used in favor of the full CALS model. This can
	  be "toggled" back with a single parameter entity
	  change
	
	- The version number has changed dramatically to make
	  it clear that it tracks 3.1.  (Version 1.3 of the
	  XML version of DocBook 3.1 was just too confusing!)
	
	- I added parameter entities to include/exclude the
	  dbcentx.mod and dbnotnx.mod modules all at once
	
	- Fixed a few small content model bugs

	* docbookx.dtd: Added marked sections around dbnotn and dbcent modules

1999-03-16  Norman Walsh  <ndw@nwalsh.com>

	* dbpoolx.mod: In the XML exchange table model case, the attlist for informaltable was wrong

1999-03-11  Norman Walsh  <ndw@nwalsh.com>

	* calstblx.dtd: Removed unused PEs

	* dbpoolx.mod: Added switch for exchange or CALS table model; made exchange the default

	Changed version number to 3.1.1.

	* dbnotnx.mod: Changed the PUBLIC identifiers that were just a single word (like
	"DITROFF") back into SYSTEM identifiers.  I don't know why I made
	the PUBLIC in the first place.

	just "DocBk30 XML".

	* db3xml.dtd: Added dbnotnx.mod; added notations back into the DTD.  Notations don't
	require system identifiers, so the public IDs will be just fine.

	Unicode versions of the entity sets to the distribution.

	* dbcentx.mod, dbnotnx.mod: New file.

	  is now optional.
	- Parameterized element and attribute declarations separately.

	- Added optional title to MsgSet
	- Added inline Constant for marking up constants and limits
	- Added inline VarName for marking up variable names

	  accidentally left out in 3.0: Graphic, LegalNotice, ModeSpec,
	  SubjectSet, KeywordSet, and ITermSet.
	- Added pagewide attribute to Figure, added InformalFigure
	- Added person name elements to Address.
	- Added Class attribute to LiteralLayout indicating Monospaced or
	  Normal font.
