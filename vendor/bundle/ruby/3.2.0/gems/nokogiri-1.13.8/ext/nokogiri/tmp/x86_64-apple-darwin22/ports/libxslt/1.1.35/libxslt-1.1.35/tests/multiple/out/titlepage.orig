<h2>Canting Dictionary</h2>
<p>A Collection of the Canting Words and
  Terms, both ancient and modern,
  used by Beggars,
  Gypsies, Cheats, House-Breakers, Shop-Lifters,
  Foot-Pads, Highway-Men, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Taken from <i>The Universal Etymological English Dictionary</i>,
  by N. Bailey, London, 1737, Vol. II, and
  transcrib'd into XML Most Diligently by Liam Quin.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>English spelling has evolved greatly since this
  dictionary was publish'd.  In the Eighteenth Century, Capital Letters
  were generally used for Nouns, and the spelling of a word could vary
  from one occurrence to the next. <i>Cloaths</i>, <i>Clothes</i> and
  <i>Cloathes</i> all seem to have been used, for example.
  You'll just have to deal with it.</p>
  <p>Note also that <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> are treated as if they were the same
  letter, as are <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, so that <i>Urchin</i> appears in
  the dictionary quite a way after <i>Vamp</i>, since the U is sorted as if it
  were a V.</p>
