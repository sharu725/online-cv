README for the Simplified DocBook XML V4.1.2.4 DTD

This is a simplified version of the DocBook XML V4.1.2 DTD.  This
DTD is my attempt to make a small subset of DocBook.  I tried to
achieve the following goals:

 * Documents written in the subset must be 100% legal DocBook XML
   documents.

 * This is for small documents, articles and the like, so
   there's no need for 'book's or 'set's, just 'article's.

 * The markup should be the smallest practical subset, if you
   need richly structured markup, use DocBook or DocBook XML.

 * The result is roughly "HTML-level markup in DocBook", but I
   didn't set out explicitly to produce that result.

 * The DTD must work in IE5 (it's XML not SGML). It should be
   small enough to download more-or-less painlessly.

 * There should be a CSS stylesheet for it (mine's pretty lame).

 * There should be an XSL stylesheet for it. Since I'm in the
   somewhat privileged position of knowing how many changes are
   coming, I'm going to wait until after the next draft ;-).

Instead of DocBook's 350+ elements, this DTD has just over 100.

Installation
------------

Place the files in this distribution somewhere on your machine.  Adjust
your catalog(s) if appropriate (XML tools frequently do not support 
catalogs, so this may be irrelevant for you).

Please use the following formal public identifier to identify this DTD:

  "-//Norman Walsh//DTD Simplified DocBook XML V4.1.2.4//EN"

For example, if your document's top-level element is <article>, and
you are using this DTD directly, use the FPI in the DOCTYPE
declaration:

<!DOCTYPE article
          PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DTD Simplified DocBook XML V4.1.2.4//EN"
                 "http://nwalsh.com/docbook/simple/4.1.2.4/sdocbook.dtd" [
...
]>


Note: if you are using the customization layer directly (sdocbook-custom.dtd),
you may have to adjust the system identifier that points to the DocBook XML
DTD.  You may also have to install the DocBook XML V4.1.2.4 DTD somewhere on
your system.
