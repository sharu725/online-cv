          The most frequently asked question of new contributors who
          join the GDP is "which document should I start
          with?". Because most people involved are volunteers, we do
          not <i>assign</i> projects and applications to
          write documents for. The first step is all yours - you must
          decide what about GNOME interests you most and find out if
          it has complete documents or not.
        </p><p>
          It is also important to spend some time with GNOME to make
          sure you are familiar enough with it to be
          <i>authoritative</i>  in your writing. The
          best way to do this is to just sit down and play with GNOME
          as much as possible before starting to write.
        </p><p>
          The easiest way to get started is to improve existing
          documentation. If you notice some inaccuracies or omissions
          in the documentation, or you think that you can explain the
          material more clearly, just send your suggestions to the
          author of the original documentation or to the GNOME
          documentation project at <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:docs@gnome.org">docs@gnome.org</a>&gt;</tt>.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="doctable"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="doctable"></a>The GNOME Documentation Status Table</h4></div></div><p>
          The <i>GDP Documentation Status Table</i>
          (<i>DocTable</i>) (<a href="http://www.gnome.org/gdp/doctable/" target="_top">http://www.gnome.org/gdp/doctable/</a>) is a
          web page which tracks the status of all the various
          documentation components of GNOME.  These components include
          application documentation, internal GNOME component
          documentation, user documentation, and developer
          documentation.  For each documentation item, it tracks the
          current status of the documentation, who is working on the
          particular document, where the documentation can be found,
          and provides a forum for the discussion of each item.
        </p><p>
          You should use the <i>DocTable</i> to help
          you select a documentation item which needs work done.  Once
          you have selected an item to work on, please register
          yourself as an author so that other authors do not duplicate
          your work and may contact you to help or offer suggestions.
          Also be sure to keep the status icons up-to-date  so that
          the GDP team can easily identify which items need additional
          help.  The <i>DocTable</i> also allows
          people to make announcements and suggestions and to discuss
          issues in the comments section.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="id2810555"></a>Note</h3><p>
          Note that the information in the
          <i>DocTable</i> may not always be up-to-date
          or accurate.  When you assign yourself to documenting an
          application, make sure you find out the latest status of
          documentation by contacting the application author.

        All documentation for the GNOME project is written in SGML
        using the DocBook DTD. There are many advantages to using
        this for documentation, not least of which is the single
        source nature of SGML. To contribute to the GDP you should
        learn to use DocBook.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="id2810638"></a>NOTE</h3><p>
          To get started writing for the GDP you do not need to rush
          out and learn DocBook - if you feel it is too much to handle
          for now, you can submit plain ASCII text to the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/" target="_top">
          <i>gnome-doc-list mailing list</i>
          </a>and a volunteer will mark it up for you. Seeing your
          document marked up will also be a great way for you to start
          learning DocBook.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="installingdocbook"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="installingdocbook"></a>Installing DocBook</h4></div></div><p>
          Download and install the following <a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com:/pub/docbook-tools/" target="_top">DocBook Tools packages</a>: jade, docbook,
          jadetex, sgml-common, and stylesheets. (RPM users should note
          that jade is platform dependent (eg. i386), while the other packages
          are in the <tt>noarch</tt>
          directory.) You can find more 
          information on DocBook Tools <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/docbook-tools/" target="_top">here</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you are an Emacs user you may
          want to grab the psgml package as well. This is a major mode
          for editing sgml files in Emacs.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="gdpstylesheets"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gdpstylesheets"></a>GDP Stylesheets</h4></div></div><p>
          The GDP uses its own DocBook stylesheets.  To use the GDP
          stylesheets, you should download the file
          <tt>gdp-both.dsl</tt> from the <tt>gnome-docu/gdp/dsssl</tt> module in
          CVS (or from <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/stylesheets.html" target="_top">
          GDP Custom DSSSL Stylesheet</a>)and copy it

          over the file
          <tt>/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/cygnus-both.dsl</tt>.
          Alternately, you can download and install the
          <a href="http://people.redhat.com/dcm/software.html" target="_top">gnome-doc-tools package</a> which will set
          up the stylesheets as well as the DTD discussed below.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="gdpdtd"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gdpdtd"></a>GDP DTD (PNG Image Support)</h4></div></div><p>
          Due to some license issues involved with the creation of
          gifs, the GNOME Documentation Project has decided to use the
          PNG image format for all images in GNOME documentation. You
          can read more about the issues involved with gifs at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html</a>.
        </p><p>
          The current DocBook DTD(3.1) does not include support for
          embedding PNG images in your documents.  Since the GDP uses
          many screenshots in its documentation, we use our own
          variation on the DocBook DTD which has PNG image support.
          We encourage everybody to use this DTD instead of the
          default DocBook DTD since your source document header and
          your output document appearance subtly vary between the two
          DTD's.  To install the GDP custom DTD with PNG image support
          by hand:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li style="list-style-type: opencircle"><p><a name="id2811052"></a>
              Download <a href="http://www.labs.redhat.com/png/png-support.html" target="_top">the
              GDP DocBook DTD for PNG support</a> and install it
              where you keep your DTD's. (On Red Hat use <tt>/usr/lib/sgml/</tt>.) Note that
              the 3.0 DTD is missing support for the
              <tt>&lt;legalnotice&gt;</tt> tag, so it is
              recommended that you use version 3.1
            </p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a name="id2811114"></a>
              Add the new DTD to your SGML CATALOG file.  The location
              of your SGML CATALOG file may vary depending upon your
              distribution. (On Red Hat it is usually in
              /usr/lib/sgml/CATALOG.) Add the following line to this
              file:
              <pre class="programlisting">
PUBLIC "-//GNOME//DTD DocBook PNG Variant V1.0//EN" "png-support-3.0.dtd"
              </pre> 
              If you are using the 3.1 DTD, use:
              <pre class="programlisting">
PUBLIC "-//GNOME//DTD DocBook PNG Variant V1.1//EN" "png-support-3.1.dtd"
              </pre> 
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          Alternately, you can download and install the
          <a href="http://people.redhat.com/dcm/software.html" target="_top">gnome-doc-tools package</a> which will set
          up the custom stylesheets and DTD for you.
        </p><p>
          To include PNG files in your documents, you will need to
          indicate that you are using this special DTD.  To do
          this, use the following headers:
        </p><p>
          Articles:

        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="editors"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="editors"></a>Editors</h4></div></div><p>
          There are many editors on Linux and UNIX systems available
          to you. Which editor you use to work on the sgml documents
          is completely up to you, as long as the editor is able to
          preserve sgml and produce the source in a format that is
          readable by everyone.
        </p><p>
          Probably the two most popular editors available are
          Emacs and
          vi. These and other editors are
          used regularly by members of the GDP. Emacs has a major
          mode, psgml, for editing sgml files which can save you time
          and effort in adding and closing tags. You will find the
          psgml package in DocBook Tools, which is the standard set of
          tools for the GDP. You may find out more about DocBook Tools
          in <a href="indexs02.html#installingdocbook" title="Installing DocBook">the section called &#8220;Installing DocBook&#8221;</a>.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="make-output"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="make-output"></a>Creating Something Useful with your Docs</h4></div></div><p>
          The tools available in DocBook Tools allow you to convert
          your sgml document to many different formats including html
          and Postscript. The primary tool used to do the conversion
          is an application called Jade. In
          most cases you will not have to work directly with
          Jade; Instead,  you will use the
          scripts provided by DocBook Tools.
        </p><p>
          To preview your DocBook document, it is easiest to convert
          it to <tt>html</tt>. If you have installed the
          DocBook tools described above, all you have to do is to run
          the command <tt>$</tt><b>db2html
          mydocument.sgml</b>. If there are no sgml syntax
          errors, this will create a directory <tt>mydocument</tt> and place the
          resulting html files in it. The title page of the document
          will typically be
          <tt>mydocument/index.html</tt>.  If you have
          screenshots in your document, you will have to copy these
          files into the <tt>mydocument</tt> directory by
          hand. You can use any web browser to view your document.
          Note that every time you run <b>db2html</b>, it
          creates the <tt>mydocument</tt> directory over, so
          you will have to copy the screenshots over each time.
        </p><p>
          You can also convert your document to PostScript by running
          the command <tt>$</tt><b>db2ps
          mydocument.sgml</b>, after which you can print out or
          view the resulting .ps file.  
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="id2811592"></a>NOTE</h3><p>
            The html files you get will not look quite the same as the
            documentation distributed with GNOME unless you have the
            custom stylesheets installed on your machine. DocBook
            Tools' default stylesheets will produce a different look
            to your docs. You can read more about the GDP stylesheets
            in <a href="indexs02.html#gdpstylesheets" title="GDP Stylesheets">the section called &#8220;GDP Stylesheets&#8221;</a>.
          </p></div></div><div class="sect3"><a name="jadeimages"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="jadeimages"></a>Images in DocBook Tools</h4></div></div><p>
          If your document uses images you will need to take note of a
          few things that should take place in order for you to make
          use of those images in your output.
        </p><p>
          The DocBook Tools scripts and applications are smart enough
          to know that when you are creating html you will be using
          PNG files and when you are creating Postscript you will be
          using EPS files (you must use EPS with Postscript).
        </p><p>
          Thus, you should never explicitly
          include the extension of the image file, since DocBook
          Tools will automatically insert it for you. For example:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;My Image&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;screenshot&gt;
  &lt;screeninfo&gt;Sample GNOME Display&lt;/screeninfo&gt;
  &lt;graphic  format="png" fileref="myfile" srccredit="me"&gt;
  &lt;/graphic&gt;
 &lt;/screenshot&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
     </pre><p>
          You will notice in this example that the file
          <tt>myfile.png</tt> was referred to as simply
          <tt>myfile</tt>. Now when you run
          <b>db2html</b> to create an html file, it will
          automatically look for <tt>myfile.png</tt> in
          the directory.
        </p><p>
          If you want to create PostScript output, you will need to create an
          EPS version of your image file to be displayed in the
          PostScript file. There is a simple script available which
          allows you to change a PNG image into an EPS file
          easily. You can download this file - img2eps - from <a href="http://people.redhat.com/dcm/sgml.html" target="_top">http://people.redhat.com/dcm/sgml.html</a>
          (look for the img2eps section).  Note that this script is
          included in the gnome-doc-tools package, so if you are using
          this package, you should already have
          <b>img2eps</b> on you system.

          For all screenshots of windows that typically have border
          decorations (e.g. applications and dialogs, but not applets
          in a panel), GDP standards dictate
          the appearance of the window.  (This is to minimize possible
          confusion to the reader, improve the appearance of GNOME
          documents, and guarantee the screenshot is readable when
          printed.) All screenshots should be taken with the SawFish
          (formerly known as Sawmill) window manager using the
          MicroGui theme and Helvetica 12pt font. (A different window
          manager can be used provided the MicroGui theme is available
          for this window manager and the appearance is identical to
          that when using the SawFish window manager.) The default
          GTK+ theme(gtk) and font (Helvetica 12 pt) should be used
          for all screenshots.  If you are unable to provide
          screenshots in this form, you should create screenshots as
          you wish them to appear and send them to the
          <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/" target="_top">
          <i>gnome-doc-list mailing list</i> </a>
          requesting a GDP member reproduce these screenshots in the
          correct format and email them to you.

          There are many tools for taking screenshots in
          GNOME/Linux. Perhaps the most convenient is the
          Screen-Shooter Applet. Just click
          on the window icon in the applet and then on the window you
          would like to take a screenshot of. (Note that
          at the time of this writing, PNG images taken by
          screenshooter do not appear properly in
          Netscape or the
          GNOME Help Browser.  You
          should save your screenshot as a GIF and
          then use <b>convert filename.gif
          filename.png</b>.) For applets
          in a Panel,
          xv can be used to crop the
          screenshot to only include the relevant portion of the
          Panel. Note that
          xv and 
          gimp can both be used for taking
          screenshots, cropping screenshots, and converting image
          formats. 
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="screenshotfiles"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="screenshotfiles"></a>Screenshot Files</h4></div></div><p>
          Screenshots should be kept in the main documentation
          directory with your SGML file for applets, or should be
          kept in a directory called "figs" for application and other
          documentation.  After you use <b>db2html</b> to
          convert your SGML file to HTML (see <a href="indexs02.html#make-output" title="Creating Something Useful with your Docs">the section called &#8220;Creating Something Useful with your Docs&#8221;</a>), you will need to copy your
          screenshots (either the individual PNG files for applet
          documentation, or the whole "figs" directory for other
          documentation) into the newly created HTML directory.  Note
          that every time you use <b>db2html</b> the HTML
          directory is erased and rewritten, so do not store your only
          copy of the screenshots in that directory.  If you wish to
          create PostScript or PDF output, you will need to manually
          convert the PNG images to EPS as described in <a href="indexs02.html#jadeimages" title="Images in DocBook Tools">the section called &#8220;Images in DocBook Tools&#8221;</a>, but will not need to copy these
          images from their default location, as they are included
          directly into the output(PostScript of PDF) file.

        Documentation authors tend to investigate and test applets and
        applications more thoroughly than most 
        users.  Often documentation authors will discover one or
        more bugs in the software.  These bugs vary from small ones,
        such as mis-spelled words or missing
        About dialogs in the menu, to large
        ones which cause the applet to crash.  As all users, you
        should be sure to report these bugs so that application
        developers know of them and can fix them.  The easiest way to
        submit a bug report is by using the Bug
        Buddy applet which is part of the gnome-applets
        package.

        CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool that allows
        multiple developers to concurrently work on a set of
        documents, keeping track of the modifications made by each
        person.  The files are stored on a server and each developer
        checks files out, modifies them, and then checks in their
        modified version of the files.  Many GNOME programs and
        documents are stored in CVS.  The GNOME CVS server allows
        users to anonymously check out CVS files. Most GDP members
        will need to use anonymous CVS to download the most up-to-date
        version of documentation or programs.  Modified documents will
        typically be emailed to the the application developer. Core
        GDP members may also be granted login CVS privileges so they
        may commit modified files directly to CVS.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="anonymouscvs"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="anonymouscvs"></a>Anonymous CVS</h4></div></div><p>
          To anonymously check out documents from CVS, you must first
          log in.  From the bash shell, you should set your CVSROOT
          shell variable with <b>  export
          CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'</b>
          and then login with <b>cvs login</b>(there is no
          password, just hit return). As an example, we will use the
          "gnome-docu/gdp" module which contains this and several
          other documents. To check these documents out for the first
          time, type <b>cvs -z3 checkout
          gnome-docu/gdp</b>. After you have this document
          checked out and you would like to download any updates on
          the CVS server, use <b>cvs -z3 update -Pd</b>.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="logincvs"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="logincvs"></a>Login CVS</h4></div></div><p>  If you have been given a
        login for the GNOME CVS server,  you may commit your file
        modifications to CVS.  Be sure to read the following section
        on CVS etiquette before making any commits to CVS.  To log in
        to the CVS server as user
        <b><i><tt>username</tt></i></b> with a
        password, you must first set your CVSROOT shell variable with
        <b> export
        CVSROOT=':pserver:<i><tt>username</tt></i>@cvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'</b>.
        Log in with <b>cvs login</b> and enter your
        password. You may check out and update modules as described
        above for anonymous CVS access.  As a login CVS user, you may
        also check modified versions of a file into the CVS server.
        To check
        <b><i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> into
        the CVS server, type <b>cvs -z3 commit
        <i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>. You will be
        given a vi editor window to type in a brief log entry,
        summarizing your changes.  The default editor can be changed
        using the <tt>EDITOR</tt> environment variable or
        with the <b><tt>-e</tt></b> option. You
        may also check in any modifications to files in the working
        directory and subdirectories using <b>cvs -z3
        commit</b>.  To
        add a new file to the CVS server, use <b>cvs -z3 add
        <i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>, followed by the
        commit command.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="cvsetiquette"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="cvsetiquette"></a>CVS Etiquette</h4></div></div><p>
          Because files in CVS are typically used and modified by
          multiple developers and documentation authors, users should
          exercise a few simple practices out of courtesy towards the
          other CVS users and the project leader.  First, you should
          not make CVS commits to a package without first discussing
          your plans with the project leader.  This way, the project
          leader knows who is modifying the files and generally, what
          sort of changes/development is being done.  Also, whenever a
          CVS user commits a file to CVS, they should make an entry in
          the CVS log and in the <tt>ChangeLog</tt> so
          that other users know who is making modifications and what
          is being modified.  When modifying files created by others,
          you should follow the indentation scheme used by the initial
          author.
