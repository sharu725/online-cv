    <title>Panel Basics</title>
   <para>
    Using the GNOME <interface>Panel</interface> is very simple and
    will come easily to anyone who has used a graphical desktop
    environment.  This section will give you a basic introduction to
    help you get started, and the following sections will discuss the
    various Panel objects and features in more detail.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="intropanel">
    <title>Introduction to Panel Objects</title>
    <para>
     A <interface>Panel</interface> can hold several types of objects.
     The example <interface>Panel</interface>  in  <xref
     linkend="examplepanelfig" /> shows each type of Panel object.

    <para>
     This example <interface>Panel</interface> contains the following
     objects:  <itemizedlist>    <listitem>
       <formalpara>
        <title>Menus</title>
        <para>
         Menus are lists of items, each of which either starts an
         application, executes a command, or is a submenu.  In the
         example <interface>Panel</interface> in <xref
         linkend="examplepanelfig" /> , the left-most  icon  after the
         arrow is a stylized footprint icon (the GNOME logo). This is
         the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, one of the most important
         objects in the <interface>Panel</interface>.  This menu
         provides access to almost all the applications, commands, and
         configuration options available in GNOME. The <guimenu>Main
         Menu</guimenu> is described in detail in <xref
         linkend="mainmenu" />. The second icon shown is a folder, the
         default icon used for user menus.  GNOME allows users to
         create their own menus with personalized contents to use in
         addition to the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>.  To open a
         menu, just click on the icon with the left mouse button.  For
         more information on menus, see <xref linkend="menus" />.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <formalpara>
        <title>Launchers</title>
        <para>
         Launchers are buttons which either start an application or
         execute a command when you press them (click with the left
         mouse button). The third icon in the example
         <interface>Panel</interface> is a launcher which starts the
         <application>Gnumeric</application> spreadsheet.  For more
         information on launchers, see <xref linkend="launchers" />.
        </para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <formalpara>
        <title>Applets</title> <para>  Applets are applications which
        run inside a small part of the
        <interface>Panel</interface>. The fourth through eighth icons
        in the example <interface>Panel</interface> are applets. The
        first applet shown is the <application>GNOME
        Weather</application> applet, which periodically downloads the
        current weather conditions off the Web and displays the
        information. The second applet shown is the <application>Drive
        Mount</application> applet, which shows whether a disk (in
        this case, the floppy drive) is mounted and allows you to
        mount and unmount the drive with a single click of the mouse.
        The third applet shown is the <application>Quick
        Launch</application> applet, which acts as a container for
        launchers, but saves more space than placing your launchers
        directly on the <interface>Panel</interface>. In the example
        shown the <application>Quick Launch</application> applet
        contains six application launchers.  Next is the
        <application>GNOME Desk Guide</application>, which allows you
        to control multiple virtual desktops, each of which can have
        multiple screens.  You can move between desktops and screens
        by clicking with your left mouse button.  The final  applet
        shown is the <application>Tasklist</application>, which allows
        you to control your application windows in various ways,
        including changing the focus,  iconifying windows, closing
        windows, and killing applications.  The
        <application>Tasklist</application> shown is for a screen with
        only two windows, both of which are <application>Electric
        Eyes</application>.  For more information on applets, see
        <xref linkend="applets" />.

        <title>Drawers</title>  <para>   Drawers are essentially
        extensions of a <interface>Panel</interface> which can be
        opened or closed.  They can hold anything the
        <interface>Panel</interface> can.  The brown icon of a drawer
        in the example  <interface>Panel</interface> is the default
        icon for drawers, although any icon can be used. Click on the
        <guiicon>Drawer</guiicon> icon with the left mouse button to
        open or close it.  For more information on drawers, see <xref
        linkend="drawers" />.

        <title>Special Objects</title>
        <para>
         Special objects are items you can add to a
         <interface>Panel</interface> which perform functions which
         are generally not available through the other
         <interface>Panel</interface> objects. The last item in the
         example <interface>Panel</interface> is a special object
         called the <guibutton>Logout Button</guibutton>. Pressing
         this with the left mouse button  begins the logout sequence
         to end your GNOME session. For more information on special
         objects, see <xref linkend="specialobjects" />.

     objects (see <xref linkend="appletadd" />).

   </sect2>

 
   <sect2 id="rightclick">
    <title>Right-Click Menu</title>
    <para>
     Clicking on any Panel object with the right mouse button brings
     up the Panel object's <guimenu>right-click</guimenu> menu. This
     menu contains <guimenuitem>Remove from panel</guimenuitem> for
     removing the object from the <interface>Panel</interface>,
     <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem> for  moving objects within the
     <interface>Panel</interface> or between two
     <interface>Panels</interface>,  the
     <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> submenu described below, and
     typically one or more object-specific menu items.  For drawers,
     menus, and launchers the only object-specific item is
     <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> which allows you to
     customize the properties and settings of the object. For applets,
     the <guimenu>right-click</guimenu> menu will often contain
     <guimenuitem>About...</guimenuitem> for viewing information about
     the applet such as the author's name and the applet version,
     <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> for viewing the applet's
     documentation,  and <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> for
     configuring preferences and settings for the applet.  Applets
     often have other applet-specific controls in their
     <guimenu>right-click</guimenu> menus.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> submenu allows you to <link
     linkend="panelmove">create and remove
     <interface>Panels</interface></link> and <link
     linkend="appletadd">add objects</link> to the
     <interface>Panel</interface>.  It also allows you to modify the
     properties of the particular <interface>Panel</interface> of
     interest using the  <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu
     item (see <xref linkend="panelproperties" />) or the properties of
     all <interface>Panels</interface> using the <guimenuitem>Global
     Preferences...</guimenuitem> menu item (see <xref
     linkend="globalpanelprefs" />).
    </para>
    <para>
     You can also right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface>
     itself. This will bring up the <link
     linkend="mainmenu"><guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu></link>. In
     particular, this menu also contains the
     <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> submenu described above.

     Pressing one of these arrows will hide the
     <interface>Panel</interface> by sliding   it in the direction of
     the arrow pressed, so that the only part of the
     <interface>Panel</interface> which remains visible is the
     <guibutton>Hide</guibutton> button itself.   Pressing it a second
     time will expand the <interface>Panel</interface>.
    </para>
    <para>
     <interface>Panels</interface> can be configured to automatically
     hide when you are  not using it and reappear when you move the
     mouse to the part of the screen where the
     <interface>Panel</interface> resides. This can be useful if you
     are unable to run your system in a high resolution.  To learn how
     to have a <interface>Panel</interface> auto-hide, see <xref

     The default way to log out is by using the
     <guilabel>Logout</guilabel> option, which ends your GNOME session
     but does not shut down the computer.  Depending on your system
     configuration, you may also have the <guilabel>Halt</guilabel>
     option, which shuts down the computer, and the
     <guilabel>Reboot</guilabel> option, which will reboot the
     computer.

     <title>Logging Out and Window Managers</title>
     <para>
      If you are running a window manager that is GNOME compliant, the
      logout feature will quit the window manager as well as GNOME. If
      you are running a non-compliant window manager you will have to
      quit the window manager yourself.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     You can disable the <interface>Logout</interface> dialog so that
     selecting the <guimenuitem>Log out</guimenuitem> menu item will
     end your GNOME session without asking any questions. To do so,
     start the GNOME <application>Control Center</application> by
     selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Settings</guisubmenu> <guisubmenu>Startup

     allows you to do this by locking the screen, requiring a password
     to unlock it. To lock your GNOME session, right click on either
     end of a <interface>Panel</interface> and select
     <guimenuitem>Lock screen</guimenuitem>.  Alternately, if you have
     the <guibutton>Lock Button</guibutton>(see <xref

   <title>Tearing Off a Menu</title>
   <para>
    All menus in GNOME have the tear-off feature: if you left-click on
    the "perforation" (thin dashed line at the top of the menu, right
    above the menu title), the menu will be turned into a separate
    window on your desktop, which will stay there even after you move
    the mouse cursor elsewhere. This is very convenient if you will be
    using the same command from some deeply nested submenu
    frequently. To remove a "torn-off" menu from your desktop, click
    on the <guibutton>Close</guibutton> button in the window title
    (its appearance and location depends on the window manager you are
    using, but usually it is the rightmost button, labelled by an "x").

   <sect2 id="menusconf">

    <para>
     You can easily change a menu name and icon (for user menus only,
     not for submenus taken from the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>). To
     do so, click on the menu, right-click on the menu title (at the
     very top of the list, above all other items), and select
     <guimenuitem>Properties&hellip;</guimenuitem> from the pop-up
     menu. This will bring up the  <interface>Desktop Entry

     <interface>Create Menu Item</interface> dialog, in which you can

     Finally, a frequently asked question is "How I can change the

 <sect1 id="launchers">
  <title>Launchers</title>
  <para>
   Launchers are buttons which reside in your

   command when clicked.  A launcher can use any icon and has a
   customized tooltip to display a message when the cursor is passed
   over the launcher.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can change a launcher's properties, such as the icon it uses
   and its name, by right-clicking on the launcher and selecting
   <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> from the pop-up menu. This
   brings up the <interface>Launcher properties</interface> dialog,
   shown in <xref linkend="launcherpropsfig" />. A similar dialog is
   used when you create a new launcher (see <xref
   linkend="add" />). Note that internally GNOME makes no distinction
   between menu items and launchers: these are just different
   representations of the same thing. You can place any menu item on a
   <interface>Panel</interface>, and it will appear as a
   launcher. Therefore, all the information below applies equally to
   launchers and menu items.

   Applets are GNOME applications which reside in a

<!-- ###########  Drawers  ############## -->
 <sect1 id="drawers">
  <title>Drawers</title>
  <para>
   The simplest way to think about a drawer is that it is a container
   to store things.  Typically one may use a drawer to hold multiple
   launchers which are related to each other in some way, such as the
   various applications in GNOME Office. The drawers in the GNOME
   <interface>Panel</interface> take this one step further by making a
   drawer an actual extension of the <interface>Panel</interface>
   itself.  Thus, a drawer is a collapsible branch of an existing
   <interface>Panel</interface>.  It can contain anything that a
   <interface>Panel</interface> can, including launchers, applets, and
   other drawers.

   Once you have placed a drawer on a <interface>Panel</interface>,
   you may click on it to "open" the drawer, revealing its contents.

   You can close the drawer by clicking on its icon again or by
   clicking on the arrow at its end.

   You can configure a drawer's properties by right clicking on the
   drawer's icon and selecting

   <interface>Drawer Properties</interface> dialog. Here you can
   select the icon used for the drawer by clicking on the icon. A
   tooltip may be entered by typing in the
   <guilabel>Tooltip/Name</guilabel> entry. This tooltip will be
   displayed whenever the mouse is moved over the drawer to remind you
   what is inside.  One may also select whether the <guibutton>hide
   button</guibutton> and arrow are displayed at the end of the drawer.

               <title>Creating Menus By Hand</title>
	       <para>
                Advanced users can also create new menus
                manually. To do so, you need to know that internally,
                GNOME represents a menu by a directory, with menu items
                presented by files of special type
                (<filename>.desktop</filename> files &mdash; these files
                also represent the application launchers), and submenus
                presented by subdirectories. For example, the
                <guimenu>Favorites</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
                directory <filename>~/.gnome/apps</filename> (where
                <filename>~</filename> denotes your home directory), and
                the <guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
                directory
                <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>. Thus, you
                can create a new directory, using the GNOME File
                Manager, drag and drop there any
                <filename>.desktop</filename> files from any other
                directories you might have (for example, from
                <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>) or from the
                desktop, and then drag and drop this directory from the
                File Manager window to the
                <interface>Panel</interface>. This will add this
                directory as a menu to the <interface>Panel</interface>.
	       </para>
              </note>
	      <para>
                After you have added a menu to your
                <interface>Panel</interface> using any of  the methods
                described above, you can modify its properties (for
                example, add new items to this menu or change the icon
                used by the menu), as described in <xref

	  class="directory">/etc/X11</filename>

	  <programlisting>
              XkbModel "pc104"

	    the edge's ends or the center. For <interface>Sliding
	    Panel</interface>, you must specify the edge and offset
	    from one of the corners (in pixels). Finally, for

	    orientation (horizontal or vertical) and position of

          <guilabel>Panel size</guilabel> &mdash; Here you can
	  choose the <interface>Panel</interface> width. The default
	  size is 48 pixels, which is
	  also the default size of icons used by GNOME. Users with low
	  screen resolution might want to decrease the
	  <interface>Panel</interface> size to
	  free some screen space; conversely, users with high
	  resolution displays may try using larger
	  <interface>Panel</interface> sizes.

        <para>
          Changing <interface>Panel</interface> size automatically
          resizes all the icons on this <interface>Panel</interface>,
          which can lead to some quality loss. Also,
          the <interface>Panel</interface> will ask all the applets to resize
          themselves. Most of the applets will comply; however, if
          some applets do not obey this request, then the
          <interface>Panel</interface> will resize itself so that it
          can fit all the applets.

    <title>Current bugs and limitations</title>
    <para>
      Most of the things here are not really bugs; rather, they
      describe situations when the <interface>Panel</interface>'s
      behavior is not what you would expect.
   </para>

    <para> 
      You cannot place an ordinary file or directory on the
      <interface>Panel</interface>. If you try to drag and drop a file
      from the File Manager window to the
      <interface>Panel</interface>, it won't work. The only type of
      file that can be placed on the <interface>Panel</interface> are
      <filename>.desktop</filename>
      files, which describe launchers (and
      <filename>.kdelnk</filename> files, which describe launchers in
      the format used by K Desktop Environment); any directory dropped on the
      <interface>Panel</interface> will be interpreted as a menu
      &mdash; that is, all the
      files other than <filename>.desktop</filename> files will be
      ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      Editing menus other than the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>
      is rather confusing. <application>Menu Editor</application> at
      the moment cannot be used for this, and the
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item of the right-click
      menu is not too helpful either - for example, it doesn't allow
      one to change the menu's icon (see <xref linkend="menusconf" /> for
      instructions for doing this). This will be improved in the next
      release.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <guimenu>Global Menu</guimenu> (which you get by
      pressing the
      <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> key
      on the keyboard or by
      right-clicking on the <interface>Panel</interface>), and the
      <guimenu>Main
      Menu</guimenu> (which you get by clicking on the foot icon)
      are configured separately. The reason is that you
      can have several <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu> buttons on
      different <interface>Panel</interface>s.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <guibutton>Screen Lock</guibutton> button does not lock the
     screen if <guilabel>No Screensaver</guilabel> is set in the
     <application>GNOME Control Center</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The only way of changing a <interface>Panel</interface>'s type
      (Edge, Aligned, etc.)
      is by choosing <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> <guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
      <guisubmenu>Type</guisubmenu>  </menuchoice> from the
      <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu> or <guimenu>Global Menu</guimenu>:
      you can not change <interface>Panel</interface> type in the 
      <interface>Panel Properties</interface> dialog. Conversely,
      <menuchoice> <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
      <guisubmenu>Background type</guisubmenu></menuchoice> allows
      you to change the background type (Pixmap/Color/Standard), but
      not to choose the actual color or image to use.
